# TASK: Who likes it?

# DESCRIPTION:
# You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or 
# other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

# Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the 
# display text as shown in the examples:

# []                                -->  "no one likes this"
# ["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
# ["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
# ["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
# ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

# Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.

# STRINGS FUNDAMENTALS
