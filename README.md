# my_codewars_com_works

This are my works on [codewars.com]('https://www.codewars.com/').

All the tasks can be used **for FREE** by everyone. 
Especially for those, who is improving or just testing his coding skills with :snake: (Python).

The shared solutions have been verified through the site's system as "correct", although there may be other, more elegant solutions.

Of course I recommend first to try solve the task without checking my solution.
:wink:

I wish you a lot of joy by coding

... and don't forget relaxing sometimes!
